Dataset for: Fire in the Tree: The Origin and Distribution of Fire-adapted Traits within Conifers and their Influence on Speciation Rates across the Conifer Phylogeny.  

What everything is and how to use it:

Ancestral State Reconstruction: 

To run code:

Conifer Phytools Code for Publication.R – R file to get reconstructions
conif_spcies_fire_master_post_20032023.csv – trait file for R script
lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018

Pagel Climate Trait Correlations:

lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018
climate_csv_07112022.csv - had the climate necessary to run R code
Pagel Correlation Multiple side facing plots loop.R - Loops through entire csv spreadsheet and produces phylogenies


BAMM:

BAMM_Script_divcontrol_march_conifer_correct_priors.txt – need to download BAMM but then use this to run it
lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018, need to run BAMM

Bamm Script for Publication.R – post divcontrol text run, use this to see results.

Outputs in publication (use Bamm Script for Publication.R)

event_data_man6-8.txt – output file needed to run R script for results in publication
mcmc_out_man6-8.txt – other output file needed to run R script for results in publication

HiSSE:

Hisse Final Code 03202023.R – use this to run program
use_for_pub_conif_spcies_fire_master_forhisse.csv -trait file for hisse
lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018

MiSSE:

FireMiSSE.R – use this to run everything
lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018

LSBDS:

FireLSBDSext.Rev – use this code first to run
SummFireLSBDS_AncStates.Rev – turn LSBDS anc states into MAP tree files
lesfinally2018.tre – Newick formatted tree from Leslie et al. 2018
